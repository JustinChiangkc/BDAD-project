# Road 2 H1B
The project aims to provide international students in tech about what skills/programming languages would lead you to a H1B VISA in the future.

We collected job descriptions of tech jobs (software engineer, data engineer, data scientist..etc), H1B salary, and H1B acceptance data for the analysis.

For each skill/programming language, we provide the expected salary and the H1B acceptance counts.

By the result, international students in tech can have a better understanding of what skills/programming language they should invest their time to maximize the return. 

**Please check the RoadToH1B.pdf for detailed information and feel free to explore the tableau result.**
